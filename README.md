# JavaScript Coding Quiz

## Description

This project was created to push my skills as a coder and develop a simple coding quiz challenge using a variety of techniques. For this project I had to utilize HTML classes to their fullest, responsive CSS styling, and dynamic JavaScripting that enabled a more novel experience for users. Local storage and jQuery were relied upon heavily to support this project.

This simple coding quiz gives users the opportunity to quickly test on their JS knowledge. This project serves as a framework that can be expanded with additional questions or content.

## Usage

Anyone is welcome to use or duplicate this project as they would like. High scores are only saved to the user's local storage and are not shared with others.
